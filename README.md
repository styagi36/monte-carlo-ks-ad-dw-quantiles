# Empirical Reference Tables for KS, AD, and DW Statistics

This repository provides large-scale Monte Carlo simulation results for:
- **Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic**
- **Anderson–Darling (AD) statistic**
- **Durbin–Watson (DW) statistic**

## Contents

- Python code for running the simulations
- CSV files with quantiles for various sample sizes, distributions, and regression settings
- Python dependency list

## How to Use

- Lookup quantiles for your desired sample size and distribution in the included CSV files.
- See the provided Python code for how to reproduce or extend the simulations.

## Sample Sizes and Settings

- **KS/AD:** Sample sizes from 5 to 1000; distributions: normal, uniform
- **DW:** Sample sizes from 20 to 1000; predictors: 1, 2, 3
